### Purpose
The purpose of this report is to analyze the exponential distribution. Both the mean and standard deviation of the exponential distribution are 1/lambda, where lambda is the rate parameter. In this report we are using a lambda value of 0.2.

### Data Simulation
For our simulation, we are going to sample 40 values from the exponential distribution in 1000 simulation runs. The code to run the simulation is as follows:

```{r readinData}
set.seed(25)
lambda <- 0.2
expectedMean <- expectedSd <- 1/lambda
numSamples <- 40
numSims <- 1000
sampleData <- matrix(rexp(numSamples * numSims, lambda), ncol = numSamples)
means <- apply(sampleData, 1, mean)
variances <- apply(sampleData, 1, var)
```
